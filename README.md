#React.js Form with Routing README

This README provides an overview of the React.js form application that allows users to enter their name, location, and language. Upon submitting the form, the application will route to another page displaying the entered data.

This is a simple React.js application that demonstrates the creation of a form with three fields: Name, Location, and Language. Upon submitting the form, the application uses React Router to navigate to another page, where the entered data is displayed.

Prerequisites
To run this application, you need to have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v12 or later)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
git clone <repository_url>

Navigate to the project directory:
cd react-trainee

Install the project dependencies:
npm install

Start the development server:
#npm start

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Usage
1. Home Page - Form
The home page of the application contains a simple form with three fields: Name, Location, and Language. Users can enter their details in these fields.

2. Submitting the Form
To submit the form, click on the "Submit" button. The application will process the form data and navigate to the next page.

3. Data Page - Displaying Entered Data
Upon form submission, the application will navigate to another page (Data Page) using React Router. On this page, the data entered in the form will be displayed.
